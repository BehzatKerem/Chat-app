# Chat-app
 Basic chat-app with socket io
 Communicate with other users in real time. It uses socket.io to handle bidirectional communication between the client and the server.
 Chat-app is a personal project that I created to improve my skills in web development. Itâ€™s not ready for the use as a real time project, as I encountered    some difficulties with deploying it to a remote server and ensuring its security and scalability. However, I learned a lot from this project and I hope to improve it in the future.
